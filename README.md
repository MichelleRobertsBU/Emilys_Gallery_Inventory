Emily's Gallery Inventory

This is my final project for Code Louisville, Software Development 1. The project creates
a way for Emily, my niece or client in this context, to track her Gallery of paintings. 
The goal is to eventually connect this console application with a website where she ca
n offer her paintings for purchase. I want Emily to be able to add and remove paintings,
along with getting a total count for her inventory. 

The project was built in Visual Studio 2022 with .Net 6.0 Framework. It will run as a 
Console Application. References for the project include Newtonsoft.Json Package. The project 
has been uploaded to GitHub under MichelleRobertsBU/Emilys_Gallery_Inventory. This is the 
link: https://github.com/MichelleRobertsBU/Emilys_Gallery_Inventory.git.

Final project requirements included having one class and an object of that class, which is 
populated with data. My Menu Item Class, and the inherited classes qualify for that. The data
is then used in the application. That is true for all the inherited Menu Classes. Three functions
or methods are required to be created and called, one of which must return a value for the application.
Each of my Menu items have a function, which returns a value for the application.


The required features list includes implementing a master loop console application, creating
an inherited class, reading data from an external file, analyzing text, and displaying information 
regarding it. My Main Menu is a master While loop console application which requires user input and 
includes a choice for exiting the program. The Menu Items, such as Add New Painting and Remove Painting
are derived from the Main Menu Item base class. The public override bool function that both uses is inherited 
from the Main Menu. I have chosen to use a Json text file to store data on the Paintings in Emily's
Gallery, so that it can 
eventually be used to store additional data on each Painting. Finally, the
Menu Item Class Number of Paintings, counts the number of paintings in the list and returns that value
on the Console Application. 

I hope you enjoy the program. Updates will follow as I become a more proficient coder!
